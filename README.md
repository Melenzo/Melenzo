Dear Ma’am,

	We the undersigned 4th year student of Bachelor of of Science in Information Technology, are currently conducting a study entitled “POINTJOB: A JOB ASSISTANCE AND APPOINTMENT FOR POLYTECHNIC COLLEGE OF LA UNION“ as a requirement to our course.

	This proposal study aims to develop “POINTJOB: A JOB ASSISTANCE AND APPOINTMENT FOR POLYTECHNIC COLLEGE OF LA UNION” The purpose of our capstone project is to streamline the process of job assistance and appointment scheduling within the school. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly platform where staff can report maintenance issues by uploading pictures, and administrators can efficiently manage and schedule appointments for utility personnel to address these problems. Key features include real-time issue tracking, automated scheduling, and notification systems to ensure timely resolutions.
	In this connection may we request your good office to allow us to conduct an interview in order to gauge the viability of our proposal.

The researcher owes to you the completion and success of the study.


Respectfully Yours,
